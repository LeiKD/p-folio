    <h3>Travel Agency</h3>

    <h3>My Pet</h3>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="bg">
    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Eldoret, a town about six hours from Kenya's capital, Nairobi.</p>
    <p>I attended the Eldoret Union School before joining Alliance High School from where I cleared on the month of November, 2018</p>
    <p>I have never held an employee position in my life. However, in high school, I used to volunteer as a <em>Librarian</em> in the local library.After high school, I took up a chance to volunteer as a grade school <em>tutor</em> at the Eldoret Union School where I taught grade 7 Math and English language.</p>
    <p>Having grown up in a low-income family, I did not have access to much of technological knowledge. However, my experience in high school opened my eyes to the rapid growth of technological innovation all over the world.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, living with my cousin who is an IT Specialist for two months after high school exposed me to a coding atmosphere that sparked my interest in software development. I trust that equiping myself with programming skills before matriculating into college in pursuit of computer science as a major is my best call at the moment.</p></div>
